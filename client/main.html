    <p>
      It stands for "Narrative Online Roleplaying <span class="mumble">something
      something</span> Powered by Apocalypse World".
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a storytelling, roleplaying game, played over the internet. The players don't
      all have to be online at the same time, so it'll fit into busy schedules like a
      play-by-post game would - you can log in and take a few actions whenever you can.
      But also it'll use the
      <a class="reference" href="http://apocalypse-world.com" target="_blank">Apocalypse World</a>
      engine to produce powerful, human, dramatic stories - something which can be
      difficult to achieve in play-by-post.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, though, there's nothing here. See the
      <a class="reference" href="http://twitter.com/ProjectNorthpaw" target="_blank">Project Northpaw Twitter feed</a>
      for a bit more detail on what's happening and where we're going. (Only very
      irregular updates, though - I wouldn't bother following the account. It's just
      a convenient place to host short updates.)
    </p>
    <p>
      All sounds pretty exciting, though, right?!<br />
