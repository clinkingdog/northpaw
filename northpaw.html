    <h1 class="page-title">Welcome to Project NORTHPAW!</h1>
    <p>
      It stands for "Narrative Online Roleplaying <span class="mumble">something
      something</span> Powered by Apocalypse World".
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a storytelling, roleplaying game, played in turns over the internet.
      I'm hoping it'll fit into busy schedules like a play-by-post game would,
      so you can log in and take a few actions whenever you have time -
      but I'm also hoping it'll also support the powerful, human, dramatic stories
      of games like
      <a class="reference" href="apocalypse-world.com" target="_blank">Apocalypse World</a>,
      which is something I haven't experienced in most play-by-post games.

      At the moment, though, there's nothing here.<br />
      ... Except this button, which doesn't do anything, but isn't it pretty?<br />
      <button class="action-primary">Yes!</button>
